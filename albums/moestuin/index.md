##In the beginning...

Some photos of the plants in their young stage, approximately 2 weeks since
sowing the seeds. The peppers came out last.

##Replanting

The courgette started getting too big, so we replanted them into bigger pots.
It was a sunny day, but still a bit cold.

Nooo!! It was a bit too cold outside for this one. Let's hold it up with some
sticks...

It needs a day to recover.
